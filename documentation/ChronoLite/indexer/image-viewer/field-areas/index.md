# Field areas

Field areas are an important concept for the image viewer.
They represent the values that have been either designated by ChronoScan processing or by user selection.

As in the form viewer [Field values linked to image areas](./documentation/chronolite/indexer/form/index?id=field-values-linked-to-image-areas), 
a coloured area represents a type of field.

### Selecting values from the image.

Form field values can be filled in by selecting text on the image viewer.
To do so, it is important to focus the field we want to enter its value from an image area and the select the text directly by clicking on a recognized text
or by drawing a zone with the mouse over the area we want to select the values from.

* Selecting a single value from the image
    >  Hover directly on a recognized text and press mouse right button

### Deleting field areas

!> **important** In order to delete field areas, [pop-up field forms](./documentation/chronolite/indexer/pop-up-field-form/index) must be activated on the [indexer settings](./documentation/chronolite/indexer/indexer-settings/index).

Select either the field with the area or the area itself to make the pop-up form appear.

* Once the pop-up form is visible, see the two buttons inside the <span class="in_magenta">Rectangle</span> on below image
